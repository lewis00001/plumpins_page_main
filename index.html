                <div class="sel-title data-h">The Importance of Play</div>
                <p>
                    “Play is so important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by
                    the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights as a right of every child.”
                    <br>
                    https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/1/182
                </p>
                <div class="sel-title data-h">Play is Essential</div>
                <p>
                    “The overriding premise is that play (or some available free time in the case of older
                    children and adolescents) is essential to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional
                    well-being of children and youth.” “Play allows children to use their creativity while
                    developing their imagination, dexterity, and physical, cognitive, and emotional strength.
                    Play is important to healthy brain development.” “When play is allowed to be child driven,
                    children practice decision-making skills, move at their own pace, discover their own areas
                    of interest, and ultimately engage fully in the passions they wish to pursue.”

                <div class="sel-title data-h">Play and Learning</div>
                <p>
                    "In play, children develop a lasting disposition to learn. Having control over the course
                    of one’s own learning, as in free play, promotes desire, motivation, and mastery. Children
                    also learn how to seek out knowledge; play involves exploration, hypothesis testing, and
                    discovery. What is more, all this is done in a safe, anxiety- and risk-free environment
                    where children are free to test the limits of their knowledge and abilities with relatively
                    few repercussions. They learn to have confidence in their ability to solve a problem, and
                    they become resilient in the face of a challenge. Play builds the foundation for a lifetime
                    of learning. In play, children develop a lasting disposition to learn. Many of these skills,
                    first developed through play, are crucial for success in the 21st century. There is no doubt
                    that amassing knowledge of the world around us continues to be important in our society – and
                    playful learning can help children to learn content-based lessons, too."
